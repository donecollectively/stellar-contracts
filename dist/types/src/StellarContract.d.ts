     * the validator function).
     *   - See below for more about ***setup & type-generation*** if your editor doesn't  provide auto-complete for
     *    the activities.
     *
     * ### A terminology note: Activities and Redeemers
     *
     * Although the conventional terminology of "redeemer" is universally well-known
     * in the Cardano developer community, we find that defining one or more **activities**,
     * with their associated ***redeemer data***, provides an effective semantic model offering
     * better clarity and intution.
     *
     * Each type of contract activity corresponds to an enum variant in the contract script.
     * For each of those variants, its redeemer data contextualizes the behavior of the requested
     * transaction.  A non-enum redeemer-type implies that there is only one type of activity.
     *
     * Any data not present in the transaction inputs or outputs, but needed for
     * specificity of the requested activity, can only be provided through these activity details.
     * If that material is like a "claim ticket", it would match the "redeemer" type of labeling.
     *
     * Activity data can include any kinds of details needed by the validator: settings for what it
     * is doing, options for how it is being done, or what remaining information the validator may
     * need, to verify the task is being completed according to protocol.  Transactions containing
     * a variety of inputs and output, each potential candidates for an activity, can use the activity
     * details to resolve ambiguity so the validator easily acts on the correct items.
     *
     * ### Setup and Type generation
     * #### Step 1: create your script **`.hlb.ts`**
     * With a defined script bundle, `import YourScriptNameBundle from "./YourBundleName.hlb.js"`
     * to your StellarContracts class module, and define a `scriptBundle() { return new YourScriptNameBundle() }` or
     * similar method in that class.
     *
     * This results in a generated **`.typeInfo.d.ts`** and **`.bridge.ts`** with complete
     * typescript bindings for your on-chain script (trouble? check Plugin setup below).
     *
     * #### Step 2: Import the generated bridge class
     * Using the generated .bridge file:
     * > `import YourScriptNameDataBridge from "./YourBundleName.bridge.js"`
     *
     * ... and set the `dataBridgeClass` property in your class:
     *
     * >    `dataBridgeClass = YourScriptNameDataBridge`
     *
     * ### Plugin Setup
     *
     * The activity types should be available through type-safe auto-complete in your editor.  If not,
     * you may need to install and configure the Stellar Contracts rollup plugins for importing .hl
     * files and generating .d.ts for your .hlb.ts files.  See the Stellar Contracts development
     * guide for additional details.

/**
 * Gathers and manages submission of a batch of linked transactions
 * @remarks
 * Initialized with a pool of named submitters, the batch-submit controller
 * gathers a set of transactions in collaboration with one or more
 * transaction-context ("tcx" or StellarTxnContext) objects.
 *
 * Those tcx's provide the batch controller with a set of tx-descriptions,
 * either describing themselves `{id, description, tcx, ...}` or describing
 * a set of linked `addlTxns`.  Each of those linked transactions may itself
 * resolve to a tcx having its own bounded set of `addlTxns`.  This leads
 * to an eventually-bounded tree of resolved transactions, each having
 * a short, locally-unique string `id`.  The submit controller
 * shepherds those transactions through their path from being
 * known-but-abstract (description-only), to being resolved, then
 * signed as needed and submitted through TxSubmitMgr objects.
 *
 * The tx-descriptions added to the batch-controller are exposed for
 * presentation in the UI layer, and each one also contains a notifier
 * object - an event emitter that the UI can use to easily subscribe to
 * changes in the state of each transaction as it makes progress.
 *
 * It is expected that the transaction batch will generally be signed as
 * a unit after on-screen review, either with a wallet-specific "sign multiple"
 * strategy or using a series of individual tx-signing interactions (i.e. with
 * less-capable wallet interfaces).  To achieve this, the batch controller is
 * designed to use a signing-strategy object, which works in the abstract
 * on either individual transactions or the entire batch.  When working
 * with wallets having various different mechanisms or APIs for multi-signing
 * (or not having them), the strategy object provides a simple interface to
 * support wallet-specific implementation of the intended result.
 *
 * For single-tx-signers, the signing-strategy object is expected to indicate
 * step-wise progress, so the UI can be signalled to incrementally present
 * related details about each tx as appropriate for the dApp's user-interaction
 * model).  Full-batch signing strategies SHOULD NOT emit single-tx signing
 * signals.
 *
 * Once the signature(s) are collected for any tx, the submit-controller
 * creates txSubmitMgrs for that tx, and it aggregates the net state of
 * each transaction's submission progress. The aggregated information
 * about per-tx progress is included in state updates emitted to subscribers
 * of that transaction's change-notification events, for UI-level presentation
 * purposes.
